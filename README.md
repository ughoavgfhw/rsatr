thRow Stuff At The Rug[g] is a simple game which involves throwing objects at a Rug[g]. Even though it is posted on GitHub, it has nothing to do with code. It is posted here so that others can take the rules, try the game, and post any changes they come up with. Hopefully no one has a problem with using GitHub for this.
