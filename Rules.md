# thRow Stuff At The Rug[g] - Official Rules #

## System Requirements ##

1. A Rug (with an extra g, if possible) with spaces (preferably squares) of various colors.
2. Various objects (the Stuff) to throw at the Rug[g]; Preferably glass rocks of various colors. 10 Stuff objects per User is recommended.
3. Space to place the Rug[g]; for advanced play, choose a location which is not level.
4. At least two Groups, each consisting of one or more Users. There needs to be at least one different type of Stuff object for each group, preferably one for each User.

## Setup ##

Place the Rug[g] in the Space. Give each User the same number of Stuff objects, with each type of Stuff object being used by no more than one Group. Have all Users sit or stand around the Rug[g].

Take the first letter of the current month. The User whose first name starts with that letter is the Starting User for the first round. If no User meets this requirement, continue with the next month, and so on. If multiple Users meet the requirement, continue with the next letter in their names, and so on. If multiple Users have the same first name, continue with the last name. If multiple Users have the exact same name, figure it out for yourself.

## Objective ##

A round is won by the Group which controls the most spaces after all Stuff objects have been thrown.

The game is won by the Group which has won the most rounds. The total number of rounds, or a total game time, should be determined before the first round.

## Gameplay ##

The Starting User throws a Stuff object towards the Rug[g], using an underhand throw, in an attempt to Claim, Secure, Nullify, or Override a space on the Rug[g]. These moves are described below. Then, play continues with the User to the left of the Starting User, and so on, until each player has thrown all of their Stuff objects. If a User throws a Stuff object out of turn, they are verbally chastised by the other user, and they must retrieve the Stuff object.

### Moves ###

**Claim**: A space is Claimed when a Stuff object first lands on it. If the Stuff object is on the edge between two spaces, it does not count.

**Secure**: A space is Secured when the Group which has already Claimed it lands another Stuff object on it. This has no special meaning other than that it will be harder for another Group to Nullify or Override the space.

**Nullify**: A space is Nullified when the number of Stuff objects belonging to any specific group on that space is not more than the number of Stuff objects belonging to the other groups combined on that space.

**Override**: A space is Overridden if it was previously Nullified, but no longer is because a Group has more Stuff objects on it than all other groups combined.

While Stuff objects which do not stop on the Rug[g] may be removed from play for the round, those on the Rug[g] should not be removed, even if they are on a line or a Nullified space, since they can be moved if another Stuff object hits it.

### Choosing a Round Winner ###

After all Users have thrown their Stuff objects, perform the following steps to determine the winner:

1. Remove Stuff objects which are on the edge between spaces.
2. Remove Stuff objects which are on Nullified spaces.
3. For each space, remove all Stuff objects except one belonging to the owning Group (the Group which has most recently Claimed or Overridden it).
4. Count the number of remaining Stuff objects for each Group. The Group which has the most left is the winner of the round.

If playing another round, the Starting User for the next round is the User to the left of the Starting User for the current round. After all rounds, the Group with the most round wins is the overall winner.

## Variations ##

- **No Nullifying**: The Nullify and Override moves are removed. However, the Group which Claims a space must have an odd number of Stuff objects on it to score.

- **Limited Nullifying**: Nullification happens only if there are three Stuff objects on the space, and only one belongs to the Group which Claimed it. The Group which Claimed it may regain control by adding a second Stuff object, but except after Nullification the Group must have an odd number of Stuff objects on it to score.

- **Color Ownership**: The first Group to land on a space of a given color owns that color, and no other team can own a space of that color. To score a space, the Group must own that color and have more Stuff objects than all other Groups combined on that space. If Groups are allowed to own more than one color, Loss of Ownership should also be used.

    - **Loss of Ownership**: If all of a Group's spaces of a given color are Nullified, that Group loses ownership of the color. If the Group which Nullified the last space has enough Stuff objects on a space of that color to Claim or Override it, that Group becomes the owner of the color. Otherwise, if the Group containing the User to the left of the User which Nullified the last space can Claim or Override a space of that color, they become the color owner, and so on.

- **Uneven Scoring**: If there are variations in the size of spaces, smaller spaces may be assigned more than one point each.

- **Per-object Scoring**: Instead of scoring one point per owned space, each Group scores one point for each of its Stuff objects on a space it owns.

## Notes ##

During gameplay, if a User spills a beverage (including one belonging to another User), all other Users must run in circles and scream while that User cleans the spill.
